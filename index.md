### At Roots Tuition, we believe you reap what you sow.

When it comes to secondary education, building a strong foundation in self-discipline, focus and curiosity is the key to future success, no matter where you come from.

Having experienced the rigour of the Oxbridge admissions process, we appreciate the relationship between effort and reward when applying. Going the extra mile beyond the confines of the classroom can make all the difference. Whether it’s through subject-specific tutoring, personal statement feedback or coaching for interviews, we’re here to see every deserving student through to their full potential.

In order to realise this mission, a portion of profits from Roots Tuition contributes to our subsidies. These make our tutoring services accessible to bright students from a greater cross-section of society, preventing these individuals from slipping through the net at school.
