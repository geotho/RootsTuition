With our tutors coming from all manner of backgrounds, we understand that tuition services are not always within reach of those who could most benefit from them. Weâ€™re acutely aware that many bright students are slipping through the net at school this way, not achieving their full potential.

A portion of profits from Roots Tuition contributes to our meritocracy project, enabling us to build more accessible packages for talented students from state comprehensive schools. If you meet our eligibility criteria below, we heartily encourage you to apply!

Please consider applying if you:

- study at a comprehensive school or sixth-form or college;
- are eligible for free school meals;
- attend a school which does not have a history of successful applications to Oxford or Cambridge;
- are the first in your family to go to university;
- are from a background which is atypical of the course you want to go and study.
